# dbt-singlestore

[dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) adapter for [SingleStore](https://www.singlestore.com/).

## Installation

dbt-singlestore is available on PyPI. To install the latest version via pip, run:

```
pip install dbt-singlestore
```

## Configuring your profile

A sample profile can be found in
[sample_profiles.yml](dbt/include/singlestore/sample_profiles.yml). It is a standard profile for SQL data sources in dbt.
In SingleStore, like in MySQL, `database` and `schema` denote the same concept. In `dbt`, and also in a number of DBMS (e.g. Postgres) `schema` has a different meaning (a namespace within a database). Therefore, `schema` must be specified in dbt profile, but it won't affect database objects by default. However, it can be used as a prefix for table names, as outlined in [dbt docs for SingleStore profile](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-profiles/singlestore-profile).

## Testing and supported versions

Default dbt [test suite](test/singlestore.dbtspec) is used to check the adapter functionality. [Development](Development.md) overview has a section "Run tests" which contains instructions on running the tests. Currently, the tests have been successfully run for the following product versions:

Singlestore | dbt-core | pytest-dbt-adapter
------------|----------|-------------------
7.8.3       | 1.1.1    | 0.6.0
7.6.6       | 1.0.1    | 0.6.0
7.5.12      | 1.0.1    | 0.6.0

To use this adapter, SingleStore must be upgraded to the version 7.5 or newer.

## Changelog

### 1.1.1
- [Fixed]((https://github.com/memsql/dbt-singlestore/issues/6)) failing materialization with `unique_key`.
